_juice_ is an open-source programming language, currently in development, which is statically typed, has a clean and
modern syntax and is easy to use. It is based on LLVM as the code-generating backend. Thanks to its type-system, which
ensures memory- and thread-safety, _juice_ prevents many bugs already at compile-time. The syntax and functionality of
_juice_ derives from multiple modern languages, like Swift, Rust, C++, and Python.
