# Contributing to _juice_

Thanks for your interest in the _juiciest_ programming language on earth!

Because there is no code yet, there is nothing much to do just now. There are a few things though:

If you are a native english speaker, you could review the website at [juicelang.org](https://juicelang.org) and
specifically the documentation at [juicelang.org/docs](https://juicelang.org/docs). You can find the repositories
[here](https://github.com/juice-lang/juicelang.org) and [here](https://github.com/juice-lang/juice-docs). If you see any
spelling mistakes or phrases, which could be better, please fix them and create a pull request. Of course you can also
correct mistakes in the README‘s of my repos or also in this file.

Create an issue at this repository, if you have an idea, which could improve the language and is not mentioned in the
[documentation](https://juicelang.org/docs).

---

That‘s all for now, there will be more options for contribution, as soon as I start pushing more code to GitHub. Stay
tuned!
